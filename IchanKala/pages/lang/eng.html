                    <p>
                        Kaltaminor was created as the largest and tallest minaret in the Muslim world by Khan of Khiva Khanate, Muhammad Amin Khan. According to his plan, the minaret should be 70-80 meters high, and the minaret's diameter, which decreases sharply as the height increases, should increase the strength of the minaret. Muhammad Amin Khan decides to build the world's tallest tower, which will surpass even the 73-meter Qutb Minar of India. The diameter of its base is 14.2 meters. Construction began in 1852, and in 1855, when the height of the tower reached 29 meters, the construction was suddenly stopped. According to Ogahi, a historian and writer from Khiva, the construction was not completed because the initiator of the construction, Muhammad Amin Khan, was killed in a battle near Serakhs in 1855. The decoration is white, green, turquoise-colored tiles were used (turquoise-colored tiles are also called kokminor because they are used a lot). On the eve of the 2500th anniversary of the city of Khiva (1996-97), the decoration of K.'s tiles was completely repaired and the inscriptions "nastlykh" on it were restored. Kalta Minor is famous for its incompleteness, as well as its unique decoration. It is the only tower completely covered with glazed tiles.

                    <p>
                        The minaret built in front of the Islamic Khoja madrasa amazes the viewer with its luxury and beauty. The height of the tower is 51 meters, half a million bricks were used for its construction. The top of the tower is finished with an elegant cornice and a domed lantern. The surface of the lantern is framed with ceramic bricks of various shapes, and the space between them is filled with colorful glazed tiles. The lantern and cornice are covered with greenish-blue, louvard (blue) and white glazed bricks. The people of Khiva describe that "Khojani Tower has decorations of four seasons and twelve months." The tower is climbed by a spiral staircase (height 35-40 cm, 118 steps). 10 holes are made around the circle so that light falls inside. 6 lattice windows are installed in the general observation deck of the upper one. The tower is decorated with a belt of 14 tiles. On top of it, a two-and-a-half-meter-high copper dome is placed, on which the image of the crescent moon, which rotates according to the movement of the wind, is placed. In 1997, this ten-piece dome was lowered to the ground, covered with gold water, and bullet holes were repaired.

                    <p>
                        Khojamberdibi madrasa - an architectural monument in Khiva (1688, 1834); In Ichan Castle, near Polvon gate. Initially, a mosque, a 10-12-room Khojamberdibi madrasah with a courtyard and a square layout (20x38 m) were built. In 1834, in connection with the construction of the Olloquli Khan madrasa, the Madrasa was rebuilt with two courtyards: it was also called "Khurjun Madrasa" because of its shape resembling a khurjun. The mosque and adjoining rooms have been preserved from the previous madrasa. From the simple one-domed gatehouse (3.0x3.0 m) one goes to the courtyards and the corridor (ramp) leading to the Olloqulikhan madrasa. Pants. in the yard (11.7x9.8 m) 10 rooms and jan. in the yard (4x7 m) there are 6 rooms and a classroom (3.5x3.5 m); the mihrab on the classroom wall shows that it was used as a mosque shows. The appearance of the building is similar to the architectural form of Olloqulikhan madrasa, the rooms are low, sometimes with domes, without simple decoration; only the door is decorated with wood carvings.

                        The madrasah consisted of 42 rooms, and 100 students studied in it. Its front side is two-story, and the high pediment makes the madrasah appear luxurious. Islam Khoja allocated 14,451 tanabs (5,780 hectares) of land from his property for the foundation of the madrasa. Above the madrasa's entrance door, a marble plaque is fixed, and the history of the madrasa's construction is written on it. The craftsman who made the tiles of the madrasa left his name on one of the tiles on the left side of the entrance. "Esh Muhammad ibn Khudoy Berdi 1328". (1910). The madrasa now houses the Khorezm Museum of Applied Arts. It contains wood carvings from priceless art masterpieces of the 13th - 20th centuries.
